    "1. Class\n",
    "Class is a user-defined datatype that contain its own data members and member functions. The member functions and data members can be accessed with the help of objects. It is the primary concept of object-oriented programming. A class is used to organize information or data so a programmer can reuse the elements in multiple instances.\n",

    "For example, if a programmer wants to make three instances of Dogs, Golden Retriever, poodle, and Maltese dog. The class dog would store similar information that is unique to each dog (although they are different species, they will have similar property attributes) and appropriate information will be associated with the class Dog.\n",
