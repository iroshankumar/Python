        "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics involves describing and summarizing data in a meaningful way. It includes measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset, including central tendency, variability, and distribution. For example, if a company wants to understand the average age of its employees, they could use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean or median age of their workforce.\n",
        "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics involves making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It allows researchers to generalize their findings from a sample to a larger population. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses, estimate parameters, and make predictions. For example, if a medical researcher wants to test the effectiveness of a new drug, they could use inferential statistics to determine if the drug is significantly more effective than a placebo, based on a sample of patients.\n",
        "Overall, both descriptive and inferential statistics are important tools for understanding and making decisions based on data. They are used in many different fields, including business, social sciences, health sciences, and more.  "
